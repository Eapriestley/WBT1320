        <h3>Minecraft Gameplay </h3>
        <p>
            Minecraftâ€™s gameplay is versatile. There is not necessarily a wrong way to play the game, unless you are playing on a game server such as Hypixel. The players may choose between playing multiplayer and single player. Additionally, there are different game modes.

        <h3>Game modes</h3>
        <p>There are different game modes that alter the way you may play: survival, creative, adventure and hardcore. Excluding creative mode, the objective of these modes are very simple. The players can interact with the 3D block, crafting and building what they desire. You may advance with these blocks as well. On the contrary, creative mode is different. Self explanatorily, the player has access to all items in the game; ultimately allowing them to create whatever they desire.</p>

<h3> Servers</h3>
<p>If the player becomes bored and disinterested in the regular gamemode, there are alternative options. The player can play through different servers with different games. My personal favorite is to play on Hypixel. Hypixel allows the players to interact in various competitive multiplayer games. If you want to unleash your creativity, you should play on build battles. There are other competitive games that involve skill such as wool wars, bed wars, duels etc. </p>
