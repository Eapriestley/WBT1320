        <h2>About the mobs</h2>
        <p>There is an estimate of 31 mobs in Minecraft. While some mobs can be small and harmless, others are potentially dangerous. Some mobs can spawn depending on the location you are in. Mobs such as the skeletons, creepers and spiders are typically found regardless of the location. The hardest mob to locate are the Wardens as they are in the “Ancient City.” Other mobs are found in different portals.  </p>
