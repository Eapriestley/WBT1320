        <h2>Bunny Diet</h2>
        <p>A rabbit's diet is not too complicated. The basic necessities for a rabbit mainly consist of water and high quality hay.
        <br> Veterinarians highly suggest people to feed their rabbits half a cup of dark leafy greens daily. Moreover, grass nuggets are another suggested food as they are high in fiber.
        <br> In fact, veterinarians state that a rabbit's food intake should consist of 80% <a href="https://www.purinamills.com/rabbit-food/education/detail/alfalfa-versus-timothy-hay-for-rabbits">Timothy</a> Hay. A common belief is that carrots make a healthy snack for rabbits. 
        <br>However, this was scientifically proven wrong as carrots contain too much sugar. Be sure to limit the amount of sugar your rabbit consumes.

        <h2>Things to Know</h2>
        <p>Adopting your first rabbit is an exciting experience. However, you must acknowledge that your rabbit will be stressed within its first week of adoption.
            <br> Here are some tips to make transitioning easier on it:
            <ul>
                <li>Do not expose your rabbit in a <a href="https://kaveecage.net/blogs/the-bunny-blog/preparing-home-for-rabbit#:~:text=Rabbits%20are%20small%20prey%20animals,to%20lower%20their%20stress%20levels">noisy/flashy</a> setting.</li>
                <li>Respect its boundaries; do not surround it at all times as it would feel unsafe</li>
                <li>Limit its space for the first week. A room too spacious could overwhelm it</li>
                <li>Lastly, be sure to read its behavioral signs!</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Managing a Rabbit</h2>
        <p>As intimidating it sounds, caring for a rabbit is definitely rewarding. They can be very cuddily and fascinating depending on your rabbit. However, there are quite a few responsibilities 
            <br> that you must abide. First, you should clean your rabbit's cage every 1-2 days. Make sure to avoid contaminating toxic chemicals! Next, rabbits can be
            <br> quite distructive. They enjoy chewing on furniture and wall frames so remember to protect your surroundings. Finally, do not neglect your rabbit. Statistically, around 80% owners free their rabbit.
            <br>Exposing your domestic rabbit to wild can be very deadly!
